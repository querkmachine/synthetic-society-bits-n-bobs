# Emojis

Emojis created for use on the Synthetic Society Discord server. In a variety of formats, because not all emoji are made the same.

Many of these are derivative of [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji), the default emoji set on Discord, in order to fit with the existing emoji sets.

Not all emoji created have been implemented, for various reasons, but are listed here anyway.

## Flags

Identity flags, pride flags, et al.

All flags are derivative of existing works, and have simply been edited to fit the proportions and corner radius used by Twemoji flags.

## Hearts

`heart_balloon` is assembled from the 'purple heart' and 'balloon' Twemoji.

`heart_digital` is assembled from the 'heart' Twemoji. The font is [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code).

`heart_machine` is a redraw of an emoji provided by Cora. Original artist is unknown. It's assembled from the 'red heart' and 'gear' Twemoji.

`heart_plushie` is assembled from the 'orange heart' and 'yellow heart' Twemoji. Thanks to Pikachu for feedback on the stitches!

`heart_rubber` is a redraw of an emoji provided by Kai. Original artist is unknown. It's derivative of the 'blue heart' Twemoji.

`heart_slime` is assembled from the 'yellow heart' and 'melting face' Twemoji.

`heart_toy` is assembled from the 'brown heart' and 'old key' Twemoji, with some tweaks made to 'old key' to better resemble a clockwork toy key.

`heart_void` is dervative of the 'black heart' Twemoji.

Other heart emojis are original creations but use elements from other Twemoji.
